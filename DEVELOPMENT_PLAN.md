# NotaWave Development Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step development process for NotaWave, an Android app with a lightweight backend for voice recording, AI-powered transcription, and extraction of summaries, to-dos, notes, and tasks. The plan is divided into phases, with each step described, estimated effort, dependencies, and a status tracker (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).

We'll follow this plan sequentially, updating statuses as we progress. If any step requires clarification or decisions (e.g., specific API keys), I'll pause and ask for input.

## Phase 1: Planning and Requirements
1. **Refine Requirements and User Stories**
   - Description: Detail core features (recording, transcription, extraction), user flows, and non-functional requirements (e.g., offline support, security).
   - Estimated Effort: 2-4 hours
   - Dependencies: User input on priorities
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Define Tech Stack and Architecture**
   - Description: Finalize backend (Node.js/Express), frontend (Android Kotlin/Jetpack Compose), AI integrations (OpenAI Whisper/GPT), database (e.g., SQLite for local, MongoDB for cloud).
   - Estimated Effort: 1-2 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 1.1
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Create Wireframes and UX Designs**
   - Description: Sketch intuitive UI for recording, dashboard, task management (e.g., one-tap recording, drag-and-drop tasks).
   - Estimated Effort: 4-6 hours
   - Dependencies: None
   - Status: Not Started

## Phase 2: Project Setup
1. **Set Up Backend Project**
   - Description: Initialize Node.js project, install dependencies (Express, Multer for audio uploads, OpenAI SDK), set up folder structure (routes, controllers, models).
   - Estimated Effort: 1 hour
   - Dependencies: Phase 1
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Set Up Android Frontend Project**
   - Description: Create Android Studio project, configure Jetpack Compose, add necessary permissions (microphone, storage).
   - Estimated Effort: 1 hour
   - Dependencies: Phase 1
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Configure Version Control**
   - Description: Initialize Git repository, create .gitignore, set up branches (main, dev).
   - Estimated Effort: 30 minutes
   - Dependencies: None
   - Status: Not Started

## Phase 3: Backend Development

2. **Integrate Transcription Service**
   - Description: Use OpenAI Whisper to transcribe audio; handle API keys securely.
   - Estimated Effort: 3 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 3.1, User input for API key
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement Extraction Logic**
   - Description: Use GPT model to parse transcription into summaries, to-dos, notes, tasks; return structured JSON.
   - Estimated Effort: 4 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 3.2
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Add Data Storage**
   - Description: Integrate database to store recordings, transcripts, and extracted data.
   - Estimated Effort: 2 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 3.3
   - Status: Not Started

## Phase 4: Frontend Development (Android)
1. **Build Recording Interface**
   - Description: Implement audio recording using MediaRecorder, with real-time UI feedback (waveform, timer).
   - Estimated Effort: 4 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 2
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Create Dashboard for Tasks and Notes**
   - Description: Design Compose UI for displaying extracted items, with categorization, search, and management features.
   - Estimated Effort: 6 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 4.1
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Integrate API Calls**
   - Description: Use Retrofit or Ktor to send audio to backend and receive processed data.
   - Estimated Effort: 3 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 3
   - Status: Not Started

4. **Add Offline Support**
   - Description: Use Room DB for local storage, sync when online.
   - Estimated Effort: 3 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 4.3
   - Status: Not Started

## Phase 5: Integration and Testing
1. **End-to-End Integration**
   - Description: Connect frontend to backend, test full workflow (record → upload → process → display).
   - Estimated Effort: 4 hours
   - Dependencies: Phases 3 & 4
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Unit and Integration Tests**
   - Description: Write tests for key components (e.g., recording, API endpoints, extraction logic).
   - Estimated Effort: 4 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 5.1
   - Status: Not Started

3. **UX/UI Testing and Refinement**
   - Description: Test intuitiveness, gather feedback, iterate on designs.
   - Estimated Effort: 2-4 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 5.1, User input for feedback
   - Status: Not Started

## Phase 6: Deployment and Polish
1. **Security and Optimization**
   - Description: Add encryption, error handling, performance tweaks.
   - Estimated Effort: 2 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 5
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Deployment Setup**
   - Description: Deploy backend to a host (e.g., Heroku), prepare Android app for release (Google Play).
   - Estimated Effort: 2 hours
   - Dependencies: Phase 6.1, User input for hosting preferences
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Final Review and Launch**
   - Description: Conduct full app review, fix bugs, launch MVP.
